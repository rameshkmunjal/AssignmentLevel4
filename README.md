## Synopsis
	For visualisation we have developed a index page.Index Page has 4 sections out of 
	which 3 appear in every page view while 1 is created to hold dynamic content .
	With every click made on navigation link   , dynamic content changes without any 
	reload .
	
	Home.html - This page is loaded in ng-view div by default as the user first opens the website.
	leagueMatches.html - This page displays info of all matches played when user clicks menu - All 
						Matches
	singleMatch.html - This page displays info of a single match when user clicks result of a match 
						in leagueMatches.html output.
	seasonSummary.html - This page displays team-wise summary position of all matches played in a season.

## Technical Specifications

    1. We have used HTML , CSS and Bootstrap to make the page responsive.
    2. We have also used media CSS settings at various break-points to maintain responsiveness.  
    3. We have used Jquery to make an image slider.
    4. We have used Javascript to generate dynamically nav links and team links housed in footer. 
    5. We have used angularJS to make this single page application.
